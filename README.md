This fork contains an updated Wiki with various enhancements and updates.  

There is also an associated version of the linux bbconsole and BlueBasic-loader for those who only need to upload bbasic programs.

bbloadlines is a line by line script loader, while slower, always seems to succeed.



I have also found that the OSX BlueBasic console does not work under OSX - Sierra.  
kscheff has fixed this = :

The BlueBasis interpreter/tester/editor continues to work under OSX - Sierra.



BASIC interpreter for CC2540 and CC2541 Bluetooth LE chips
----------------------------------------------------------

This project contains a BASIC interpreter which can be flashed onto a CC2540 or CC2541 Bluetooth module. Once installed, simple use the Bluetooth Console tool to connect and start coding on the device using good old BASIC.

The project was inspired by experimenting with the HM-10 modules (a cheap BLE module) and a need to provide an easy way to prototype ideas (rather than coding in C using the very expensive IAR compiler). Hopefully other will find this useful.
